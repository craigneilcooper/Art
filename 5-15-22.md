# Conflict with R.J.

## False Reporting is a real hot button with me and can be the kiss of death.

False Reporting is a real hot button with me and can be the kiss of death in working with me.
RJ has had a history of not telling the story how it is.

Example 1,

He said he developed the website for the credentialing platform. His support team did this. I tried to work with him and quickly realized he was taking credit for someone elses work.

I have never looked at RJ as a developer nor do I think he is capable as a developer.
I do think of him as having a future in project mananagement and did take him under my wing to help him develop out some of the project management tools. I felt bad for him from the verification side and did try to assist in helping him.

As far as me assigning deliverables. This is laughable, he is the one pushing these meetings with upper management. He made three requests that I meet with these guys every friday. RJ is the one pushing this.

They are also pushing for a meeting every Friday. I thought it was a good idea and agreed but also have the fear they are just fishing me for knowledge.

I have tried to call to talk about some of these issues and your very unavailble which I respect it's a weekend.

We do need to talk about how we want to handle intelectual property.

RJ is the one pushing and introducing me to these team members. I am not asking for it.

I also do want to have the ability to grow if they can show me something. The problem is I'm the only one training and giving my skills it seems very one sided.

We can start from the begining of this project. I had to hold them by the hand because there were so many technologies they didn't understand.

I was excited to meet with Eric. I do think it's important for you to understand it's RJ pushing these agendas with me.

At this point, I think its a great idea to polarize me from RJ as I don't do well with individuals that false reports. Its to confusing working with liars.  

Also ask him the deliverables I have assigned to him involving development of credentialing.

I spent a couple of hours helping him with the status report. In the begining, I did ask for his assistnance in developing out WBS 2. But he kept pushing how important the training was.

So I think your correct. He is working on other account creating Chaos in false reporting saying I'm assinging workloads.

At this point Im very frustrated with R.J. and will cancel all future Friday meeetings he is pushing for. I don't trust him. I will take your advice on the meetings with other upper management. He contributes little and I don't work will with people that create drama and have only one foot in a project 1/2 of the time.

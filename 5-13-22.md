# Barbara Conflict #1

## Conflict Definition

I wanted to clear up any assumptions or false narratives you have built-in RJ developing for me. I have not created any tasks for RJ in development. There has been one exception where Katherine has been extremely vocal about ISTA's data entry performance.

I helped him for less than 2 hours in developing a status report so data entry can provide the Administrators with day-to-day tasks.

As for your assumption and false narrative that he was developing for me on Friday. This was a meeting that has been planned for 2 weeks in the discussion of future deliverables and the expectations of closing out the scope of the current project next week in credentialing.

It also causes damage to me if you are vocalizing I'm using resources not assigned to me. This creates organizational chaos.

As for the constant threats of the surgery centers wanting to find other companies to work with.

This is not my decision. I feels each center needs to make its own informed decision.

It's also a growing concern of mine if the centers want to drop ISTA. I need to stop sharing information and also stop developing employees. I have invested a great deal of time to get Melvin where he is. You have invested a great deal of time to get RJ and Jay-Ar where they are.

I don't want to invest unnecessary time. Time is my largest constraint.

I feel at the end of this week. The team created a very useful platform. At this point, it's up to them not us if they want to use it.

As A son I am going to give you some feedback and I mean this in a very constructive way.

I feel people do a lot to irritate you. They get a reaction from you. They bait you. You need to learn to control this and recognize it. When it’s happening. 

Examples,

Example #1

People Baiting you.

Dr Garcia approaching you. "We want to use Dr Rojany's Nursing Model instead of Your Nursing Model."

I'm sure your response was anger and wanting to prove yourself. One thing I have learned is it's never a good idea to upset the physicians.

You could have responded "Dr. Rojany is a very smart guy and I'm glad he found a process that works for his center."

When you are at constant war with everyone nobody wants you to succeed, and they will do everything to destroy you.

Example #2

Katherine being so vocal about how awful ISTA is. It has been a serious drain on the people working so hard to put this in place. Not only a drain but I have spent 2 full days just trying to field her complaints. This is a huge problem. Administrators often have the skills to run a surgery center but have not developed the skills to deliver a large technology project. The same goes for me, I have the skills to deliver a large technology project but not necessarily the skills to run a surgery center.

A large project should have one project sponsor and that is you. To many cooks in the kitchen a project really suffers. 

Solution 
The next time Katherine starts complaining about ISTA. Give her the option to cancel ISTA at her centers and ask her what administrative staff she would like to assign to take over the roles and responsibilities.

This will pin her down and make her think. She will have two options.
1. Develop and train ISTA
2. Develop and train her own staff. 

This puts the ball in her court and will help in her continuos efforts in the reputation destruction of you and I.

We have to be prepared for whatever she chooses.

Silver lining if she chooses to cancel ISTA, Maybe ISTA will get a little more serious on the Data Entry Front. 

Either way. They go is fine with me they have a great training platform in place if they want to use our system. If they don't want to use it let them go elsewhere.
